What is Entando?
################

Entando is the lightest, open source Digital Experience Platform (DXP) for Modern Applications.

Entando harmonizes customer experience across the omnichannel applying the techniques of modern software practices to enterprise applications.

Enterprises modernizing their application development processes and platforms or building new generation applications also require modern patterns for user interface design and need to replicate them across multiple applications throughout their enterprise in a process called UX convergence; Entando is focused at providing a toolset to meet the needs for these modern applications and UX convergence projects.

Entando then unifies the user experience across different applications, people, devices while reducing technical complexity, time-to-market and project development costs.

Entando can be used both to modernize UI/UX layers on top of existing applications or to build new applications aligned to UI/UX standards, across different industries and use cases. Major use cases are: modern web and mobile applications and new generation web applications.

Open Source license allows you to customize, extend and implement any change you wish to apply to our source code. Our core is available under the LGPL v2.1 License and our components under the MIT License.

Capabilities
############
	* Robust and Reliable: Based on Java technology (Java2EE, Spring, Struts), itâ€™s easy to integrate, testable, ready for continuous integration and delivery.

	* Modular and Extensible: Services, core components, front-end layer and back-end layer are separate elements. Developers may easily work on new apps, extend core components, and create connectors to third-party systems.

	* Ease of Integration and Interoperability: Entando's open standards-based architecture provides unbeaten integration capabilities. In addition, RESTFUL APIs allow to integrate with third parties. You can expose contents, apps, and integrated systems as a service via APIs.

	* Scalability: Entando supports both multi-node clustering and replication.

	* Security: Entando follows OWASP guidelines, encryption technologies (DES, MD5 and RSA), Oauth implementation, LDAP and Active Directory 		  integration, and more.
	  Identity Management modules are extensible with secure user and password policies management, pluggable authentication, log-in procedures. 
	  Entando integrates your existing security by acquiring user credentials on a customizable single-sign-on infrastructure based on CAS.

	* Accessibility: Entando is compliant with international laws and standards in terms of accessibility for people with disabilities.

	* Usability: Entando is easy to learn and to use.

	* User Experience: Entando integrates technologies and tools used to provide interaction between a user and a set of applications, 	processes, content, services or other users.

	* UX Convergence and UI best practices: by abstracting UI patterns, processes and components, Entando allows easier and quicker to develop 		UX proof code and to share it across different applications, people and devices.

	* Rich UI Support: Entando supports user interface (UI) technologies that deliver rich experiences, including HTML5 and related technologies 		(e.g. CSS3 and JavaScript).
