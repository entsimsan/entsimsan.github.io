*****************************
Getting Started with Entando
*****************************

Here what you need to start using Entando:

    * Java JDK version >= 7

    * Ensure which JDK's version you are using, running the following command at the command prompt:

     java -version

    * Maven version >= 2.2.1 (It's recommended to use Maven up to version v3.0.5)

And this if you are going to develop:

    * Ant

With the JDK, Maven and Ant installed you are ready to go. Some detail on how to achieve that below.

Check your Installation

    Create an empty directory and generate a test web application, based on the Entando bootstrap archetype, typing bogus data when asked:

 **$ mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=entando-archetype-portal-bootstrap**

Note: Every Maven project has its groupId: this is generally unique amongst an organization or a project; artifactId: this is generally the name that the project is known by; version: this is the version of the project. Maven will ask these to you in three steps. Finally, Maven will ask you the package structure for your code.

    Enter the newly created folder
    Launch Jetty:

 **$ mvn clean jetty:run**

    Open your browser at http://localhost:8080/ (ignore the 404 error)
    Click on the link you will find on that page
